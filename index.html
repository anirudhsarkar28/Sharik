            Wishing you the happiest 19th birthday! It’s hard to believe how quickly time has flown by, from our fun adventures to all those late-night chats. Every moment I’ve spent with you has been unforgettable, and I’m so grateful to have you in my life.
        </p>
        <p class="slide-in">
            You’re not only beautiful and incredibly talented, but your kindness and thoughtfulness always stand out. You have this way of making everything better, like adding the perfect touch of color to a blank canvas. And I just want you to know—you’ll always hold a special place in my heart, no matter what.
        </p>
        <p class="slide-in">
            I hope this year brings you all the happiness and success you deserve. I’ll always be here for you, through every laugh, challenge, and adventure. You’re truly the best, Krisha, and I’m so lucky to call you my friend.
